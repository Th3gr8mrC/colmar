# This project was completed as part of a Codeacademy Intensive program that taught you how to design websites. I chose an orange, blue, and white color scheme based on the school colors of the school where I teach (I thought that Colmar Academy deserved some school colors). I alternated between the colors to create some contrast. I also wanted to create some interactivity so I created "hover" features throughout most of the website.
